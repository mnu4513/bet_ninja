            <h2>Refund Policy:</h2>

            <strong>General Overview:</strong> <br />

            Refunds are generally not provided for bets placed on our platform. All bets are considered final.
            Refunds may only be considered in exceptional circumstances, subject to the discretion of BET NINJA.
            BET NINJA reserves the right to review and make decisions on refund requests on a case-by-case basis.
            <br /><br />

            <strong>Exceptional Circumstances:</strong>
            <br />
            Refund requests in cases of technical errors or glitches in the platform will be thoroughly investigated by our support team.
            If a bet is confirmed due to a system error or malfunction, BET NINJA may, at its discretion, void the bet and refund the amount.

            <br /><br /><br />
            <h2>Cancellation Policy:</h2>

            <strong>Betting Cancellation:</strong>
            <br />
            Once a bet is confirmed, it cannot be canceled or reversed.
            Users are advised to carefully review their bets before confirmation.
            <br /><br />

            <strong>Event Cancellation:</strong>
            <br />
            If an event on which a bet is placed is canceled, postponed, or otherwise affected, BET NINJA will follow industry-standard protocols for handling such situations.
            In case of event cancellations, BET NINJA may, at its discretion, void bets related to the affected event, and refunds may be provided in accordance with applicable regulations.
