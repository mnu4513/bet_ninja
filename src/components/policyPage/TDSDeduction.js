            Here are some points to consider 
            regarding TDS in a betting app context: <br/><br/>

            Legal Compliance:<br/>

            Ensure that your betting app complies with the tax laws and regulations of the jurisdiction in which it operates. Tax laws may vary from country to country, and it's essential to understand and adhere to the specific regulations applicable to online gambling and betting activities. <br/><br/>
            Winnings Subject to TDS:<br/>

            In many jurisdictions, winnings from gambling and betting activities are subject to TDS. This includes not only the winnings from bets but also other forms of earnings, such as bonuses and promotions.<br/><br/>
            Threshold Limits:<br/>

            Check whether there are any threshold limits for TDS. In some jurisdictions, TDS may only apply if the winnings exceed a certain amount. Ensure that your app implements the necessary mechanisms to track and deduct TDS appropriately.<br/><br/>
            User Notifications:<br/>

            Clearly communicate to users about TDS deductions in your app's terms and conditions or during the withdrawal process. Users should be aware of any applicable taxes on their winnings.<br/><br/>
            Reporting and Documentation:<br/>

            Maintain accurate records of TDS deductions for reporting purposes. This documentation may be required for regulatory compliance and to provide users with necessary financial statements.<br/><br/>
            Consult with Tax Professionals:<br/>

            It is advisable to consult with tax professionals or legal experts who are familiar with the tax laws applicable to online gambling and betting activities. They can provide guidance on the specific requirements and implications of TDS in your jurisdiction.<br/><br/>
            Integration with Payment Gateways:<br/>

            If your app involves financial transactions, ensure that the payment gateway or financial service provider you use supports the necessary features for TDS compliance. This may include integrating with APIs that facilitate tax deductions.<br/><br/>
